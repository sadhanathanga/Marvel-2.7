# **Building a Model Like GPT-4**
## Step 1: Understand the Basics
- Neural Networks form the main component of LLM's. Therefore, we first need to understand the basics of Neural Network and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  which focuses on the interaction between computers and human brain.
## Step 2: Get Familiar with the Transformer Architecture
- Transformer form the core architecture of LLM. They follow the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different words in a sentence based on their relevance.
  It helps understand the context better. Positional Encoding allows them to  recognize the sequence of words.
## Step 3: Collect Data
- Data is required for training any model. Hence the relevant data has to be collected from websites, making sure there is no duplicates.
## Step 4: Preprocess the Data
- Tokenization and Encoding are the 2 process that comes into account here. Tokenization splits the text into smaller pieces called tokens (words or subwords). This is how the model understands and processes the text. Encoding converts these tokens into numerical format, so they can be fed into the neural network.
## Step 5: Build the Model
- Here we define the layers(attention layers, feedback layers) and choose parameters such as the number of layers, learning rate, and batch size. These will influence how the model learns.
## Step 6: Train the Model
- The model learns from the data. The objective here is to minimize the loss function using optimization algorithms like Adam to adjust the model’s weights based on the loss.
## Step 7: Fine-tune the Model
- After the initial training, fine-tuning can improve the model’s performance. Train the model on datasets that reflect the specific domain you want it to excel in and ddjust the hyperparameters based on the model’s performance during training.
## Step 8: Evaluate the Model
- It’s important to check how well the model performs, Using metrics to conduct real-world tests to gather feedback on how the model interacts with users.
